# INFO 550 Engagement Report

Team Lead: Rachel Sagers

Coders: Mengke Du, Nicole Hood, Mehar Anand

## Analysis Components

1. Figure showing time trends of video engagement over weeks of class

2. Generalized linear model summary table based on engagement based on topic, video number, and length

3. Visualization of total length of all videos for each topic as a bar chart

## Project Organization

### Data

The course engagement data used in project analyses is stored in the 'data' directory. To save as a data frame in RStudio, coders should use the read.csv() function.

### Code

Code files for each analysis are be stored in the 'code' directory. The code to create the linear model summary table is stored in the 'model.R' file. The code to produce the visualization plot showing the total length of all vidoes by topic can be found in the 'visual.R' file. The code to proudce the plot showing engagement over weeks of class can be found in the 'engage_time.R' file.

### Output

Figures and tables generated by the code are saved in the 'output' directory. Any .rds objects will be not be stored on the remote repository as specified by the .gitignore file.

## Final Report

The final report can be rendered by running the make command, which will execute the Makefile. The Makefile specifies rules for creating report elements, synchronizing the package environment, and rendering the final report. The final report includes a customization parameter that allows the report to be published in production mode, without code blocks, or not in production mode with the code blocks included in the output document.
